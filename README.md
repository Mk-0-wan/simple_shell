# Simple shell

Basically this is a simple implementaion of [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) shell, who among others at Bell Labs (formerly AT&T Bell Telephone Laboratories) designed and implemented The original Unix operating system.


# What's the shell ?

A shell is a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. It can be command-line-based or have a graphical user interface (GUI). In the context of operating systems like Unix, Linux, and others, a shell typically refers to a command-line interface where users interact with the system by typing commands.

## How does it work ?

1. **_Command Interpretation_**: The shell interprets user commands and translates them into a format that the operating system can understand and execute.

2. **_Scripting_**: Shells often support scripting languages, allowing users to write scripts (sequences of commands) to automate tasks.

3. **_File Manipulation_**: Users can navigate the file system, create, delete, and manipulate files and directories through shell commands.

4. **_Environment Customization_**: Users can customize their shell environment, setting variables, configuring aliases, and defining functions.

5. **_Input/Output Redirection_**: Users can redirect the input and output of commands, enabling powerful data manipulation and processing.

5. **_Job Control_**: Shells allow users to run multiple processes simultaneously and manage their execution.
